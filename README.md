# chromium-downloader-all
Download Chromium packages for mostly all platforms `Android` `Linux` `Windows` etc. <br>
It will download the prebuilt packages from [chromium-browser-snapshot](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html)<br>
You can download `extended-stable`, `stable`, `beta`, `dev`, `canary`, `latest` etc. channels depending on release availability.<br>
`latest` channel provides the latest last build of the package with all the latest features. So make a choice well while installing.
## Installing Chromium
Since the chromium builds are portable builds so after download finishes goto folder `linux`or`windows`or`mac`etc. then `latest`or`stable`or`dev`etc. then `latest` then click on chrome to run directly. To add shortcut to application menu in linux right click on chrome-wrapper script and run.
